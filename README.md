- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikolaKorbar
- 👀 I’m actively part of blockchain/crypto community since 2016. Super interested in blockchain technology a bit less in crypto. Former miner and trader, with vast academic and practical curiosity.
- 🌱 Learning about blockchain seems to never be enough. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that are not shitcoins, pump&dump schemes and similar crap that made us all look bad.
- 📫 How to reach me: Nikola Korbar on FB, LN or directly here.
